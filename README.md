# DL-Chess-Project
Project by Thomas MICHEL and Gabriel JEANTET for the Deep Learning Course of ENS Ulm

Structure :
 - The source files can be found under src/ 
 - The data should be under the pgn format in order to be formated
 - The default execution of any of the source file generally takes a list of generated dataset files as an input
 - The parameters of the execution can be modified directly inside the code
